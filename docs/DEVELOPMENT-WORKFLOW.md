# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow and best practices for the WordSlide project.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `test/*` - Testing improvements

### Commit Convention
Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `style:` - Code style changes

## Development Process

### 1. Starting a New Feature
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Development
- Write code following project standards
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Run tests frequently: `npm test`

### 3. Testing
Before committing:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage # Check coverage
npm run build         # Ensure build works
```

### 4. Committing
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new difficulty system"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Pull Request
- Create PR to `main` branch
- Ensure all tests pass
- Request code review
- Address feedback

### 6. Deployment
- Merge to `main` after approval
- Deploy via AWS Amplify (automatic)
- Monitor deployment status

## Code Standards

### JavaScript/React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use TypeScript where possible
- Consistent naming conventions

### Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities
- Write component tests for UI
- Write integration tests for flows
- Maintain >80% code coverage

### Documentation
- Update README for major changes
- Document new features
- Keep API documentation current
- Comment complex logic

## File Organization

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── contexts/       # React contexts
├── utils/          # Pure utility functions
├── test/           # Test files
└── main.jsx        # Application entry

lambda/             # AWS Lambda functions
aws-infrastructure/ # Deployment files
docs/               # Documentation
```

## Quality Assurance

### Before PR
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage maintained
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows standards
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Accessibility compliance

## Deployment Process

### Development
- Feature branches auto-deploy to preview
- Test on preview environment
- Verify functionality before merge

### Production
- Merge to `main` triggers production deploy
- Monitor deployment logs
- Verify production functionality
- Check error monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Test Failures**
   - Check test environment setup
   - Verify mock configurations
   - Update tests for new features

2. **Build Errors**
   - Check dependency versions
   - Verify import paths
   - Clean node_modules if needed

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check AWS Amplify logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check build configuration

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper authentication
- Regular dependency updates

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

## Tools and Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test             # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode
npm run test:ui      # UI test runner
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy       # Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:prod  # Deploy to production
```
