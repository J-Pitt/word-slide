**Coverage:** 85%+ across all categories

## New Files Added

### Backend
- `lambda/game/complete-game.js` - Save completion records
- `aws-infrastructure/add-completions-table.sql` - Database schema

### Frontend
- `src/components/GameCompletionModal.jsx` - Completion celebration
- `src/components/GameCompletionModal.css` - Styling
- `src/utils/completionTracking.js` - Completion logic
- `src/utils/completionTracking.test.js` - Tests (26 tests!)

### Database
- `game_completions` table - Permanent completion records

## Database Changes

### New Table: `game_completions`
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_completions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  game_mode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  levels_completed INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_words_solved INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_moves INTEGER NOT NULL,
  average_moves_per_level DECIMAL(5,2),
  completion_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Updated Leaderboard
- Now shows completion status (👑 for completed games)
- Displays completion date
- Prioritizes completed games

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint
- `POST /game/complete` - Save game completion

### Updated Endpoints
- `GET /game/leaderboard` - Now includes completion data

## User Experience Flow

1. **User plays through levels 1-20**
2. **Level 20 completed** → Completion modal appears
3. **Modal shows stats** → "You solved 60 words in 150 moves!"
4. **Stats saved permanently** → Added to leaderboard forever
5. **User stats reset** → Back to level 1, fresh start
6. **Play again option** → Start new game immediately

## Technical Implementation

### Completion Detection
```javascript
// In App.jsx - handleNextLevel
if (currentLevel === 20 && isPuzzleSolved) {
  setShowCompletionModal(true)
  saveGameCompletion()
}
```

### Stats Calculation
```javascript
// In completionTracking.js
export function calculateCompletionStats(levelHistory) {
  return {
    levelsCompleted: levelHistory.length,
    totalWordsSolved: levelHistory.reduce((sum, level) => sum + level.wordsSolved, 0),
    totalMoves: levelHistory.reduce((sum, level) => sum + level.movesUsed, 0),
    averageMovesPerLevel: totalMoves / levelsCompleted
  }
}
```

### Database Save
```javascript
// In complete-game.js Lambda
const completionRecord = {
  user_id: userId,
  username: username,
  game_mode: gameMode,
  levels_completed: stats.levelsCompleted,
  total_words_solved: stats.totalWordsSolved,
  total_moves: stats.totalMoves,
  average_moves_per_level: stats.averageMovesPerLevel
}
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Backend Deployment
- [ ] Deploy `complete-game.js` Lambda function
- [ ] Run database migration (`add-completions-table.sql`)
- [ ] Test API endpoint with Postman/curl
- [ ] Verify database table creation

### Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Merge `newgame` branch to `main`
- [ ] Run `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy to AWS Amplify
- [ ] Test completion flow end-to-end

### Verification
- [ ] Complete a full game (levels 1-20)
- [ ] Verify completion modal appears
- [ ] Check stats are saved to database
- [ ] Confirm leaderboard shows completion
- [ ] Test stats reset functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Revert database changes** (drop `game_completions` table)
2. **Revert Lambda function** (deploy previous version)
3. **Revert frontend** (merge previous commit)
4. **Monitor** for any issues

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Impact
- **Database**: One additional table, minimal queries
- **Lambda**: One additional function, lightweight
- **Frontend**: Modal component, no performance impact
