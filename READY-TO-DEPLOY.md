**If newgame is NOT your main deployment branch:**

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge newgame
git push origin main
```

---

### Option 2: Pull Request (Recommended for Teams)

```bash
# Push branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add game completion tracking with permanent leaderboard"
git push origin newgame

# On GitHub:

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Required!)

Before the feature works, you need to run the database migration:

```bash
# Connect to your RDS database
./aws-infrastructure/connect-database.sh

# Run migration
\i aws-infrastructure/add-completions-table.sql

# Verify
\dt game_completions
```

**Expected output:**
```
CREATE TABLE
CREATE INDEX
game_completions table created successfully!
```

## ⚙️ Lambda Deployment (Required!)

### Deploy New Lambda: complete-game

```bash
cd lambda/game

# Install dependencies
npm install pg

# Package
zip -r complete-game.zip complete-game.js node_modules/
