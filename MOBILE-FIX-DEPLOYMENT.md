# 📱 Mobile Fix Deployment Guide
## iPhone 15 Pro Safe Area Fix - v1.0.1

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

- **Issue**: Target words at top of game were cut off on iPhone 15 Pro after login
- **Cause**: iOS notch/Dynamic Island overlapping content
- **Solution**: Added `env(safe-area-inset-*)` CSS variables for all game views
- **Devices Affected**: All iPhones with notches (X, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 series)

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Build the Project

```bash
# From project root
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `/dist` folder.

### Step 2: Update Service Worker Version

The service worker has been updated to version `1.0.1-mobile-fix`. This ensures all users get the update.

### Step 3: Deploy to Your Server

**If using AWS S3 + CloudFront:**

```bash
# Sync files to S3
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete

# Invalidate CloudFront cache (replace YOUR_DIST_ID)
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DIST_ID --paths "/*"
```

**If using a different hosting provider:**
- Upload all files from the `/dist` folder to your web server
- Make sure to overwrite all existing files
- Clear any CDN cache if applicable

## 📱 How Your User Will Get the Update

### Automatic Update (Default - No Action Required!)

Your app has automatic updates built-in:

1. ⏱️ **Within 30-60 seconds** of opening the app (after you deploy)
2. 🔄 Service worker detects the new version automatically
3. 📥 Downloads the update in the background
4. 🚀 Shows a green notification: **"App Update Available!"**
5. ✅ Shows: **"Updated Successfully! Reloading..."**
6. 🔃 **Page auto-reloads** with the fix applied

**Your user doesn't need to do anything!**
